RMD File includes Explanatory Analysis and Regression modeling steps

In basketball there are so many different statistics such as points scored, rebounds, assists, blocks, etc. Additionally, one must also consider the defensive side that is difficult to be measured by statistics. Thus, one metric that NBA fans and sports analysts use most often is the player’s team’s point differential per 100 possession while the given player is on the court. This metric takes into consideration both the offensive and defensive capabilities of a player. If the team’s point differential per 100 possessions while the player is on the court is negative, we can assume that the player is not positively impactful to their team.
My goal for this research project is to run an MCMC regression analysis to figure out which variables impact the net rating of an NBA player, and how large the impact is.
